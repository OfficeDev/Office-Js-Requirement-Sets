# Office-Js Requirement sets

The purpose of this repository is to provide a central source of mapping of Office hosts and their corresponding OfficeJs requirement sets.
This repository can be used as a reference by Office developers to check  requirement sets are supported by host (Excel, Word, Outlook, etc.) on a given platform (Win32, Mac, Online, iOS, etc.)

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. They are similar to product version numbers. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office host supports APIs that an add-in needs.
For more information, visit Office developer [website](https://dev.office.com).

For general information about where add-ins are supported by Office host, see  [Office Add-in host and platform availability](https://dev.office.com/add-in-availability).
